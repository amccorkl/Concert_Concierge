CONCERT CONCIERGE

DESCRIPTION:
    For this project we wanted to create an application for music lovers where they can plan their perfect concert getaway and enjoy some local cuisine. They will be able to input their desired travel city and date, as well as type in what kind of food they are looking for. Then, TicketMaster will provide a list of up to 20 concerts happening in the selected city on that specific date along with a link to purchase tickets. Along with the list of concerts, there will also be a list of up to 20 bars/restaurants in that area provided by Yelp! with a link to additional information on each listing.

USER STORY:
    AS a concert goer
    I WANT to find out what concerts are happening in a specific city and date I've selected, along with local food/beverages
    SO THAT I can start planning my next music vacation

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
