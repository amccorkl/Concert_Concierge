# Concert Concierge

## Description

Concert Concierge is an interactive application built for users that are looking to plan a getaway that revolves around local music and cuisine. The user will choose the date(s) they wish to travel, as well as the city and type of _food*_, then press submit. The 2 side-server API's(TicketMaster & Yelp!) will populate the shows in 'x' city on the left and your food options on the right. 

_*Currently we have the Yelp! API turned off due to limited free query submission._
