CONCERT CONCIERGE

DESCRIPTION:
    For this project we wanted to create an application for music lovers where they can plan their perfect concert getaway. They will be able to search for their desired band/artist they want to see and what city they want to see them in. Then, once they have selected a specific event, they will be able to search for nearby bars and restaurants in that city so they can plan their vacation. There will also be a link provided by TicketMaster where the user can purchase tickets to said event.

    I WANT to find out where my favorite band/artist is playing at, be able to buy tickets, and search for local restaurants/bars
    SO THAT I can start planning my next music vacation
